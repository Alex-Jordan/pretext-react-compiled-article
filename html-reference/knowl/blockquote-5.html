<p class="para">This visualisation uses a D3 force simulation to show the Twitter relationships between the Assembly Members in the Welsh Assembly in terms of the number of times each assembly member has mentioned another assembly member in a tweet.</p>
<p class="para">Twitter relationships were mined on 22/03/2017, and are representative of the conversational relationships on that date. Links between AMs represent a conversational relationship: one AM has mentioned the other. Party colour indicates the direction of the mention.</p>
<p class="para">Hover over the nodes to fade out non-connected nodes.</p>
<p class="para">Rather than using intermediate nodes to create curved links (as in Mike Bostock's block), this adds curves by adding a calculated control point for each edge.</p>
