<div class="para">The main tools used in this proof are the division algorithm and the Principle of Well-Ordering. Let <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> be a cyclic group generated by <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and suppose that <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is a subgroup of <span class="process-math">\(G\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(H = \{ e \}\text{,}\)</span> then trivially <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is cyclic. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> contains some other element <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> distinct from the identity. Then <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> can be written as <span class="process-math">\(a^n\)</span> for some integer <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> is a subgroup, <span class="process-math">\(g^{-1} = a^{n}\)</span> must also be in <span class="process-math">\(H\text{.}\)</span>  Since either <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(-n\)</span> is positive, we can assume that <span class="process-math">\(H\)</span> contains positive powers of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n \gt 0\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> be the smallest natural number such that <span class="process-math">\(a^m \in H\text{.}\)</span> Such an <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> exists by the Principle of Well-Ordering.</div>
