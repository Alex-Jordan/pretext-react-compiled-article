<div class="para">Different books, different authors, different software all have different ideas about the order in which to write multiplication of functions.  This textbook builds on the idea of composition of functions, so that <span class="process-math">\(fg\)</span> is the composition <span class="process-math">\((fg)(x)=f(g(x))\)</span> and it is natural to apply <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> first.  Sage takes the opposite view and since we write <span class="process-math">\(fg\text{,}\)</span> Sage will understand that we want to do <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> first.  Neither approach is wrong, and neither is necessarily superior, they are just different and there are good arguments for either one.  When you consult other books that work with permutation groups, you want to first determine which approach it takes.</div>
