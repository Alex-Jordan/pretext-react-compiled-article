<div class="para">Computing large powers can be very time-consuming. Just as anyone can compute <span class="process-math">\(2^2\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(2^8\text{,}\)</span> everyone knows how to compute</div>

<div class="para">However, such numbers are so large that we do not want to attempt the calculations; moreover, past a certain point the computations would not be feasible even if we had every computer in the world at our disposal. Even writing down the decimal representation of a very large number may not be reasonable. It could be thousands or even millions of digits long. However, if we could compute something like <span class="process-math">\(2^{37398332 } \pmod{ 46389}\text{,}\)</span> we could very easily write the result down since it would be a number between 0 and 46,388. If we want to compute powers modulo <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> quickly and efficiently, we will have to be clever.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-4-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.4.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>
