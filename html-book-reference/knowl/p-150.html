<div class="para">Click just to the left of the error message to expand it fully (another click hides it totally, and a third click brings back the abbreviated form).  Read the bottom of an error message first, it is your best explanation.  Here a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ZeroDivisionError</code> is not 100% accurate, but is close.  The matrix is not invertible, not dissimilar to how we cannot divide scalars by zero.  The remainder of the message begins at the top showing were the error first happened in your code and then the various places where intermediate functions were called, until the actual piece of Sage where the problem occurred.  Sometimes this information will give you some clues, sometimes it is totally undecipherable.  So do not let it scare you if it seems mysterious, but do remember to always read the last line first, then go back and read the first few lines for something that looks like your code.</div>
